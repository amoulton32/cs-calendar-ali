# CLUBSPOT CALENDAR
Created by Ali Moulton for Clubspot Coding Assesmeny 2024

<!-- Details: -->

This project was created using React working in Vite. 

Currently, the calendar allows defaults to today's date 
with options to change the date, month, or year with a few quick clicks. 

On the right there is a view of the currently selected date, which would ideally show the 
events on the calendar for that day. Considering the scope of the project adding events 
is currently non-functional. 

Date & time data was gathered using date-fns, which provides lots of convenient tools for manipulating 
daes in javascript, and the documentation was thorough 
 <!--https://date-fns.org/  -->


 Styling was done entirely in CSS, no tailwind, etc.
